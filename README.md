# **Chemical Simulation: Acid-Base Neutralization with Python**  

## **Overview**  
This repository contains a Python-based **chemical simulation** for modeling **acid-base neutralization reactions**. The project includes **dynamic pH calculations, titration curve plotting, data exporting, and real-world chemistry applications**. Designed for **AP Chemistry students**, this simulation demonstrates how acids and bases react and how computational chemistry can predict reaction outcomes.  

## **Features**  
- **pH Calculation & Graphing** â€“ Simulates acid-base neutralization and generates titration curves.  
- **Chemical Compound Selection** â€“ Includes various acids and bases for simulations (HCl, NaOH, CHâ‚ƒCOOH, NHâ‚ƒ, etc.).  
- **Data Exporting** â€“ Outputs titration data (initial pH, titrant volume, equivalence point, final pH) as **CSV files** for analysis.  
- **Reaction Mechanisms** â€“ Uses **chemical equations and molecular diagrams** to visualize the process.  
- **Real-World Applications** â€“ Demonstrates how neutralization is used in **medicine (antacids), industry (chemical manufacturing), and environmental science (acid rain mitigation).**  
- **Visuals & Graphics** â€“ Includes **color-coded pH scales, molecular models, and reaction flowcharts**.  


### **Available Options:**  
- Choose acid and base concentrations.  
- Simulate titration and **automatically generate a titration curve**.  
- Export reaction data for further analysis.  

## **Data Export**  
Titration data can be saved in **CSV format** for further study:  

| **Volume of Titrant (mL)** | **pH Value** | **Reaction Progress** |
|----------------|----------|----------------|
| 0.0 | 2.5 | Initial state |
| 5.0 | 4.2 | Acid partially neutralized |
| 10.0 | 7.0 | Equivalence point reached |
| 15.0 | 10.5 | Excess base added |
