# **Chemical Simulation: Acid-Base Neutralization with Python**  

## **Abstract**
This project focused on creating a digital titration simulator to model acid-base reactions and help students visualize how pH changes during titration. Titration is a key technique in analytical chemistry used to determine the concentration of unknown solutions. The goal was to build a tool that could accurately simulate all major titration types—including strong-strong, strong-weak, and weak-weak reactions—and clearly show important points such as the initial pH, buffer region, half-equivalence point, and equivalence point. The motivation behind this was to make titration concepts more interactive and accessible, especially for students studying AP Chemistry.

To build the simulator, Python and the Streamlit library were used to create a user-friendly interface. Users can input custom concentrations and volumes, choose from a variety of acids and bases, and view the resulting titration curve. The backend calculations use equilibrium expressions and dissociation constants (Ka and Kb) to compute pH values across the titration. For buffer regions, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation was applied. The code also includes logic for handling special cases like weak acid–weak base titrations by calculating the equivalence point pH based on conjugate pair relationships. All results are plotted in real time using Matplotlib, with options to download the data for further analysis.

The results showed that the simulator correctly modeled the expected trends for each titration type. Strong acid–strong base titrations produced steep curves with a neutral equivalence point at pH 7. Strong acid–weak base titrations showed acidic equivalence points, while weak acid–strong base reactions had buffer regions and basic equivalence points. Even weak acid–weak base titrations, which are usually harder to model, were accurately simulated using derived equations. The app also recommended appropriate indicators based on the computed pH at equivalence.

Overall, the project demonstrated that a customizable titration simulator can successfully replicate real-world titration behavior. It can be used as an educational tool to reinforce acid-base concepts, helping students explore how chemical properties affect titration curves. This makes complex ideas like buffers, equivalence, and pH shifts easier to understand and visualize.
